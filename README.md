Allocates different colors of squares for the Cross My Heart quilt
pattern found on page 30 of Kim Brackett's _Scrap-Basket Beauties:
Quilting with Scraps, Strips and Jelly-Rolls_. This pattern features a
grid of squares that meet at their edges; we wish to place colors
squares such that no two squares of the same color are near each
other.
